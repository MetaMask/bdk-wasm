# Development Cycle

This project uses [Semantic Versioning], but is currently at MAJOR version zero (0.y.z) meaning it is still in initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable. Until we reach version `1.0.0` we will do our best to document any breaking API changes in the changelog info attached to each release tag.

We decided to maintain a faster release cycle while the library is still in "beta", i.e. before release `1.0.0`: since we are constantly adding new features and, even more importantly, fixing issues, we want developers to have access to those updates as fast as possible.

Once the project reaches a more mature state (>= `1.0.0`), we will very likely switch to longer release cycles.

To create a new release a release manager will create a new issue using the `Release` template and follow the template instructions.

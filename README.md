## About

The `bdk-wasm` library aims at providing access to the excellent [BitcoinDevKit](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk) to JS and Node environments (and eventually any device supporting WebAssembly).
It specializes in compiling BDK on the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and use [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) to create TypeScript bindings.

This repo handles the packaging and publishing of the `bitcoindevkit` NPM package, using `wasm-pack`.

This library offers all the desired functionality to build a Bitcoin wallet out of the box:

- UTXO management
- Coin selection
- Wallet upates by syncing and scanning the chain data
- Bitcoin descriptors for flexibility in the definition of spending conditions. Supports all address types from legacy to Taproot.
- State update and persistence
- Transaction creation, signing and broadcasting
- Dynamic addresses
- and much more

For a lightweight library providing stateless utility functions, see [`bitcoinjs`](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib).

## Browser Usage

```sh
yarn add bitcoindevkit
```

## Development Environment

### Requirements

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

#### MacOS special requirement

On MacOS, you should replace the default `llvm` with the one from `brew`:

```sh
brew install llvm
```

We recommend creating a `.cargo` folder at the root of the repo with the following `config.toml` file:

```toml
[env]
AR = "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar"
CC = "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang"
```

### Build with `wasm-pack build`

```sh
wasm-pack build
```

> Choose your desired features when building: `--features "esplora"`

### Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```sh
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

> Works with `--firefox`, `--chrome` or `safari`.
